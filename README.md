## An emotional experience for children ##
Project of Creative Programming and Computing @ 2020 Olivieri - Simeon - Vassena - Acerbi


The target of our system are the children. <br> 
With this system they will create a story using their fantasy and drawing their personal characters. <br> 
The purpose of this emotional installation is to give the child-user the opportunity to see his personal sketch come to life and be part of a story that will be driven by the same child.<br> 
We will use NN in order to create generative drawing.
